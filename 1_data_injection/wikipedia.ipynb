These algorithms, including Generative adversarial network (GANs) and text-to-image models, generate lifelike images, videos, or animations from textual descriptions or datasets.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe use of generative AI in the adult industry began in the late 2010s, initially focusing on AI-generated art, music, and visual content. This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative AI porn \"communities\" ===\\nPopular sites like civitai.com allow users to create, upload, and download fine-tuned versions of open source models of SDXL, Flux, and that are specifically designed for generating various pornographic scenes or effects.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (AI Undress) ===\\nGenerative AI have extensively been used to produce pornography images and videos of non-consenting individuals. 404 Me'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Generative artificial intelligence', 'summary': 'Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.

Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is trained on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\nComputers were needed to go beyond Markov chains. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural networks (2014–2019) ===\\n\\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning has used both discriminative models and generative models to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress, and research in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling.\\nIn 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire imag'), Document(metadata={'title': 'AI boom', 'summary': 'The AI boom is an ongoing period of technological progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that started in the late 2010s before gaining international prominence in the 2020s.

The event catalyzed the AI boom later that decade, when many alumni of the ImageNet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. In March 2016, AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol in a five-game match, marking the first time a computer Go program had beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. This match led to significant increase in public interest in AI. The generative AI race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of OpenAI and earlier advances made in graphics processing units (GPUs), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures.\\nIn 2018, the Artificial Intelligence Index, an initiative from Stanford University, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in AI. Europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by China and North America. Technologies such as AlphaFold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development. Economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of AI more frequently.\\nThe release of ChatGPT in November 2022, a chatbot based on a large language model created by OpenAI, accelerated the pace of AI boom. ChatGPT had over 100 million users in two months, and according to investment bank UBS, was the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. Several other companies have released competitors. At a similar time, text-to-image-models such as DALL-E and Midjourney become popular as a way to generate complicated photo-like illustrations. Speech synthesis software also became able to replicate the voices and speech of specific people.\\n\\n\\n== Advances ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biomedical ===\\nThe AlphaFold 2 score of more than 90 in CASP\\'s global distance test (GDT) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology. The structural biologist and Nobel Prize winner Venki Ramakrishnan called the result \"a stunning advance on the protein folding problem\", adding that \"It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted.\"\\nThe ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases.\\n\\n\\n=== Images and videos ===\\n\\nText-to-image models captured widespread public attention when OpenAI announced DALL-E, a transformer system, in January 2021. A successor capable of generating complex and realistic images, DALL-E 2, was unveiled in April 2022. An alternative text-to-image model, Midjourney, was released in July 2022. Another alternative, open-source model Stable Diffusion, released in August 2022.\\nFollowing other text-to-image models, language model-powered text-to-video platforms such as Runway, OpenAI\\'s Sora, DAMO, Make-A-Video, Imagen Video and Phenaki can generate video from text as well as image prompts.\\n\\n\\n=== Language ===\\nGPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.

New techniques in the years before the AI boom resulted in \"rapid improvements in tasks\", including manipulating language. Modern software models are trained to learn by using millions of examples in artificial neural networks that are inspired by biological neural structures.\\nSeparately, the concept of generative pre-training (GP) was a long-established technique in machine learning. GP is a form of self-supervised learning wherein a model is first trained on a large, unlabeled dataset (the \"pre-training\" step) to learn to generate data points. This pre-trained model is then adapted to a specific task using a labeled dataset (the \"fine-tuning\" step).\\nThe transformer architecture for deep learning is the core technology of a GPT. Developed by researchers at Google, it was introduced in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\", which was published on June 12, 2017. The transformer architecture solved many of the performance issues that were associated with older recurrent neural network (RNN) designs for natural language processing (NLP). The architecture\\'s use of an attention mechanism allows models to process entire sequences of text at once, enabling the training of much larger and more sophisticated models. Since 2017, numerous transformer-based NLP systems have been available that are capable of processing, mining, organizing, connecting, contrasting, and summarizing texts as well as correctly answering questions from textual input.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nOn June 11, 2018, OpenAI researchers and engineers published a paper called \"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training\", which introduced GPT-1, the first GPT model. It was designed as a transformer-based large language model that used generative pre-training (GP) on BookCorpus, a diverse text corpus, followed by discriminative fine-tuning to focus on specific language tasks. This semi-supervised approach was seen as a breakthrough. Previously, the best-performing neural models in natural language processing (NLP) had commonly employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually labeled data – training a large language model with this approach would have been prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.\\nOn February 14, 2019, OpenAI introduced GPT-2, a larger model that could generate coherent text. Created as a direct scale-up of its predecessor, it had both its parameter count and dataset size increased by a factor of 10. GPT-2 has 1.5 billion parameters and was trained on WebText, a 40-gigabyte dataset of 8 million web pages.
